## Assignment Description
This repository contains our work for the HTTP, HTTPS, and QUIC assignment.  
We analyzed different application-layer protocols by visiting test websites and capturing their traffic:  

- **HTTP:** Traffic captured using `http://edgedl.me.gvt1.com`  
- **HTTPS:** Traffic captured using `https://example.com`  
- **QUIC:** Traffic captured using `https://quic.rocks` (or a QUIC-enabled website)  

The repository includes:
- Captured trace files (`.pcapng`) for HTTP, HTTPS, and QUIC  
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce each capture  
- Analysis of methods, hosts, URIs, status codes (HTTP/HTTPS), and protocol behavior (QUIC)  
- README.md file with group details   

## Tools Used
- **Wireshark** (Primary tool for packet capture)
